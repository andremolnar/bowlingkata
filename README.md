#Bowling Kata Planetarium

This is the source for the bowling Kata Planetarium held at MPD.

Its not the most useful thing in the world since the point of the kata is to do it yourself repeatedly.  But maybe you want to see how someone else worked through it.

For strangers visiting - you can take a look at Agenda.md to see what this is all about.
